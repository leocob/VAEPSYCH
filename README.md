# VAEPSYCH

This repository is a fork of the MOVE (Multi-Omics Variational autoEncoder) project (https://github.com/RasmussenLab/MOVE) that I have started to work on in June 2024.
The goal was to adapt the MOVE framework to the specific needs I had for another project, of which the manuscript is in preparation. The manuscript title is
"Deep learning-based stratification of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder from real world data reveals distinct profiles of common and rare variant genetic signal".

The basic infrastructure of MOVE is unchanged, and the code can be run following the documentation at this link: https://move-dl.readthedocs.io/index.html
